# Fetal-Health-Prediction
In this project, I have used Machine learning techniques to train an artificial neural networks on the fetal health dataset and used it to classify a patient as fertile or infertile depending on the data of 45 parameters taken from the patients. The data was collected
either using google forms or in person via manual form filling. The model achieved an accuracy of 95.283% on applying a test train split of 80-20%.
